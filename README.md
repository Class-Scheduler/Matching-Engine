# class-scheduler

This program exists to mitigate the hassle of deciding which sessional
academics are assigned to each class for a given semester. It was created to
improve both the speed and efficiency of allocation relieving those responsible
of the ownerous task of performing the allocation.

The project is being developed using dotnet C# and as a result should be
compatible with all operating systems with support for dotnet.

## Usage

There are two methods which can be used to build the project in the state which
it is at the moment.

 - Running

In order to run the program in the state which it is currently in the following
command can be used.

```bash
> dotnet run
```

 - Building

You may want to build the program which will allow for extra build flags to be
incorperated. In order to do this run the following commands.

```bash
> dotnet build
```

 - Cleaning

I dont know why but if you felt like the directory wasnt clean enough you can 
use the following command to clean the directory contents before rebuilding.

```bash
> dotnet clean
```
